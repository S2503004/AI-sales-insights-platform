Optional extensions to impress:
- Add a React dashboard (hooks + charts) consuming the API with live updates.
- Implement MLflow or DVC for model versioning and experiment tracking.
- Add streaming ETL (Kafka/Flink) for real-time ingestion.
- Add role-based access and SSO (OAuth2) for the dashboard and API.
- Benchmark and optimize model; add explainability (SHAP) and unit tests for data contracts.
